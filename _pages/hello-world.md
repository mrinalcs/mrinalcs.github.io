**Hello World!**  is often the first program written by developers learning a new programming language. It's a simple exercise that introduces basic syntax and verifies the setup of a programming environment.

## The Origin
The tradition of writing a "Hello, World!" program started with Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in the book **The C Programming Language (1978)**. This example became a universal convention in computer science.

## Examples in Popular Languages

### Python
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### C
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Java
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

The Hello, World! program remains a timeless exercise, symbolizing the start of a programmer’s journey and the joy of learning a new language. Whether you’re debugging a simple print statement or building complex applications, every developer started with these first few lines of code.
