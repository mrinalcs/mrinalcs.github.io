title: First Day at Visva Bharati
---

As far I can remember its was a pandamic period after a long indecision our 2 exam got cancelled. Finaly after result I applied for admission to Visva Bharai and received a call from HoD and took admission the following day. As payment mode was SBI collect mode so I decided to visit campus.

## Expectations
As a Bengali student not only I am aware of Rabindranath Tagore and Visva Bharati and studied as well . I already had an imagination how It may look . But as there was Lockdown and university was not open for students I thought it must be empty .

## First Impressions
After a journey of 6 hours I was not feeling tired but I was full of excitement and nervousness both. The Visva Bharati was stared from the Bolpur railway station , the art on walls which till now stick me when thinking of Visva Bharati. The buildings and passing by Kala Bhaban's Sculpture I felt I was seeing what I expected. But our small department disappoint me little feels like a school. Anyway later my impression abou our department changed.

## Encounters with People
As I navigated to the dept, I encountered a few unknown faces. I got more information from the metron didi in the office where I meet our Hod. Infront of dept I meet one of my classmate and few more students who got admission the same year at Admission cell. 


## Unexpected Moments
I did not expected I could meet anyone of my classmates. But anyway we got late . We missed our train there was no train till next day afternoon so we decided to come via Suri as there is no direct bus. But the bus was so slow which makes me tired. We missed bus also but there was bus next morning.
