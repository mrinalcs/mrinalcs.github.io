### Facilities
 Rooms are not very good but each room has two tube light and a fan in center. It has a old building structure. It had all necessary facilities like water, gym, kitchen but all are not okey now.  Only one water purifier working  with regular management of students. Food quality is poor in kitchen though its managed by students. But as Hostel student we were okey with that.

### Rooms
Each rooms are two bed with table and chair (most of rooms had old stuffs). The rooms have a balcony in front. It has four window and self.

When I was choosing room there were few rooms left in front block but all of them except *room 19* were dirty and I had to clean my self. Though it has limited facilities its rooms mostely fillup.
