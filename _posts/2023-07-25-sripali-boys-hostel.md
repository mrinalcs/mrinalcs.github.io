I was alloted to Elmhirst Boys' Hostel, but distance from our department was too long. So I shifted to Sripalli Boys' Hostel 

## About Hostel


Its not the best hostel in Visva-Bharati but its near to Sikha Bhavana. It has a old building structure which actually creat more vive of Visva-Bharati. It has all necessary facilities like water, gym, kitchen but none of okey now.  Its only one water purifier and cooler is running with regular management of students. Food quality is poor in kitchen though its managed by students. But as Hostel student we were okey with that.

## My Experience

When I was choosing room there were few rooms left in front block but all of them except *room 19* were dirty and I had to clean my self. Who will clean room ? :) so obviously I choosed that room with a senior of MSc Zoology dept. My roomate speaks hindi in which I am not good. So we had a very little converstion only when necessary. But his eager ness in learning and talking in Bengali makes me confortable and I also speak Hindi when possible.

But I can't call him only roomate. But I had a restriction of sleeping awaking early, which I had no objection but I enjoyed that. I was really Inspired by him. I learned a lot from him. Worshiping to god, not disturbing other and not let others to make disturbance.
