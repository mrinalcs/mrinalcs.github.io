## Introduction
As bengali I feels rooted to these movies. I enjoyed my childhood with family watching these. Now also I enjoy Bengali movies but the number is too much limited. I likess my parent also to watch with me but I can't . I have to watch first then I can. Now in the era of webseries I will include them also as movies. Heres few which I likes 

- Gora (2015)
- Gora (TV Series 2022â€“2023)
- Parineeta 2019
- Eken Babu (TV Series 2018)

## Diverse Themes
When saying about diversness I don't think to make movies divers it sould be out of the box always. It can be divers being inside the box also.

## Cultural Representations
One thing I have noticed one thing in both Hollywood and Tollywood that It always condem Hindu things and try to lecture on secularism. A different picture can be seen in South movies where I feel more comfortable to watch. South Indian movies are more tends to its own culture. T think thats the reason of arise of those movies.

## Impact of Influences
Now a days the Bengali movies seems to be more influenced more by South Indian movies. Specially when Hindi Bollywood movies are infamous for copying. I also find harmful things to society is more errogant. Smoking and drinking alcohol seems to be an intregal part of movies. For this I am not going to give credit to only bengali movies but also Bollywood Movies. 


## Conclusion
Any way stil I love to watch bengali movies and webseries.
