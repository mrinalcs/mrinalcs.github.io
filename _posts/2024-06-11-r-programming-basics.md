R is a powerful programming language widely used for statistical computing and graphics. In this article, we'll explore the fundamentals of R programming, including variables, data types, and basic operations.

## Variables

In R, variables are used to store data values. You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator `<-` or `=`. Here's an example,

```R
# Assigning values to variables
x <- 10
y <- 5
z = 15
```

## Data Types

R supports various data types, including numeric, character, logical, and more. Let's look at some examples,

```R
# Numeric data type
num_var <- 10

# Character data type
char_var <- "Hello, world!"

# Logical data type
logical_var <- TRUE
```


## Basic Operations
You can perform basic arithmetic operations in R, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here are some examples,

```R
# Addition
sum <- x + y

# Subtraction
difference <- x - y

# Multiplication
product <- x * y

# Division
quotient <- x / y
```
