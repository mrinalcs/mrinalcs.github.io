R is a powerful programming language for statistical computing and graphics, widely used by data scientists, statisticians, and researchers. When combined with R Studio, an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for R, it becomes an indispensable tool for data analysis and visualization. In this article, So you need R and R Studio.


## Install
1. [Download and Install R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
2. [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Ok. R Studio is straightforward and intuitive

Script Editor: The top-left panel is the Script Editor. This is where you write and edit your R scripts. To create a new script, go to `File > New File > R Script`.

R Console: The left panel is the R Console, where you can type and execute R commands directly. You can think of it as an interactive interface where you can experiment with R code.

To display the value of a variable, you can use the print() function or simply type the variable name. Both methods will output the value of the variable.

```R
x <- 42
# Print the value of x using the print() function
print(x)

# Print the value of x by typing the variable name
x
```

## Variables

In R, variables are used to store data values. You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator `<-` or `=`. Here's an example,

```R
# Assigning values to variables
x <- 10
y <- 5
z = 15
```

## Data Types

R supports various data types, including numeric, character, logical, and more. Let's look at some examples,

```R
# Numeric data type
num_var <- 10

# Character data type
char_var <- "Hello, world!"

# Logical data type
logical_var <- TRUE
```


## Basic Operations
You can perform basic arithmetic operations in R, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here are some examples,

```R
# Addition
sum <- x + y

# Subtraction
difference <- x - y

# Multiplication
product <- x * y

# Division
quotient <- x / y
```


## Vectors
Vectors can hold numeric, character, or logical values. You can create vectors using the c() function.

```R
# Numeric vector
num_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Character vector
char_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# Logical vector
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

## Matrices
Matrices are the same type (numeric, character, or logical) in a two-dimensional layout. You can create matrices using the matrix() function.

```R
# Creating a numeric matrix
matrix_data <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
print(matrix_data)

# or same from vector

# Creating a matrix from a vector
vector_data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
matrix_data <- matrix(vector_data, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    4    7
[2,]    2    5    8
[3,]    3    6    9
```


### Accessing Matrix Elements
You can access elements of a matrix using square brackets, specifying the row and column indices.
 
```R
# Accessing a specific element (row 2, column 3)
element <- matrix_data[2, 3]
print(element)

# Accessing a specific row
row <- matrix_data[2, ]
print(row)

# Accessing a specific column
column <- matrix_data[, 3]
print(column)
```
### Matrix Operations
You can perform various operations on matrices, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are typically performed element-wise or as matrix operations (e.g., matrix multiplication).

Element-wise Operations
```R
# Creating another matrix for operations
matrix_data2 <- matrix(9:1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

# Element-wise addition
matrix_sum <- matrix_data + matrix_data2
print(matrix_sum)

# Element-wise subtraction
matrix_diff <- matrix_data - matrix_data2
print(matrix_diff)

# Element-wise multiplication
matrix_prod <- matrix_data * matrix_data2
print(matrix_prod)

# Element-wise division
matrix_div <- matrix_data / matrix_data2
print(matrix_div)

```

### Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication is different from element-wise multiplication and is performed using the %*% operator.

```R
# Matrix multiplication
matrix_mult <- matrix_data %*% matrix_data2
print(matrix_mult)

```

### Transposing a Matrix
Transposing a matrix means swapping its rows and columns. You can transpose a matrix using the t() function.
```R
matrix_transpose <- t(matrix_data)
print(matrix_transpose)
```







## Data Frames
You can create a data frame using the data.frame() function. Hereâ€™s an example:
```R 
# Creating a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 35),
  Score = c(90, 85, 88)
)


# Viewing the data frame
print(df)

```


### Inspecting Data Frames
```R 
# View the first few rows
head(df)

# View the last few rows
tail(df)

# View the structure of the data frame
str(df)

# Get a summary of the data frame
summary(df)

```

### Accessing Data
You can access data in a data frame using the $ operator, square brackets [], or the subset() function.
```R 
# Accessing a column using $
print(df$Name)

# Accessing a specific element [row, column]
print(df[2, 3]) # Row 2, Column 3

# Accessing multiple rows and columns
print(df[1:2, c("Name", "Score")])

```
