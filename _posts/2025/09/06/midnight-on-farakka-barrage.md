I was travelling in a bus that had stuck in traffic when I saw this view from Farakka Barrage at midnight. The bridge lights reflected beautifully on the calm Ganga River. A small boat with some people moved quietly across the water, adding life to the peaceful night scene.

Have you noticed the boat and the people? Look closely at the bottom left corner they make this quiet night moment even more special.
