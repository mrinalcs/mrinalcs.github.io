As a child, the world seemed full of magic and wonder. Everything was new, exciting, and perfect. Parents were superheroes they do everything I want, my favorite cartoons were flawless, and the idea of Magic bringing presents was pure joy. But as grown older, started noticing how things madeup in the very things that once captivated me. It's bittersweet part of growing up and losing that wonder but gaining a more realistic perspective.
 
This shift in perspective is a natural part of maturing. As we gain more information and experience, we become more critical and analytical. We start questioning things, seek evidence, and look for logic and consistency. Though I have grown up, I still get afraid of ghosts. No matter how much I try to rationalize it, a dark room and a creaky sound at night still send a chill down my spine.

However, seeing flaws isn’t all negative. It allows us to learn and improve. When I notice mistakes in my own work, I can correct them and do better next time. Recognizing imperfections in others helps me empathize and understand that everyone is human. 
 
Yes, childhood magic fades, but it makes way for something deeper. I may not see the world as perfect anymore, but I can find beauty in its imperfections. Growing up means trading wonder for wisdom, and that’s a journey worth embracing.
