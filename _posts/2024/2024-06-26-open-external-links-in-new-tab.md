Why Bother Opening Links in a New Tab?
First off, why would you want to do this? Well, opening links in a new tab can be really handy because:

It keeps visitors on your site. They can check out the external link and easily come back.
Itâ€™s less disruptive. Users don't lose their place on your site while they explore other resources.
