Generating random numbers is a common task in statistics and data analysis, especially when performing simulations, bootstrapping, or sampling. In R, there are several functions available to generate random numbers from different distributions. In this quick guide, weâ€™ll cover the basics of generating random numbers in R.

## 1. Generating Random Numbers from a Uniform Distribution

The `runif()` function generates random numbers from a uniform distribution between a specified minimum and maximum.

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers between 0 and 1
random_numbers <- runif(10)
print(random_numbers)
```

If you want numbers between different ranges, you can specify the minimum and maximum values:

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers between 5 and 15
random_numbers <- runif(10, min = 5, max = 15)
print(random_numbers)
```

## 2. Generating Random Numbers from a Normal Distribution

To generate random numbers from a normal (Gaussian) distribution, use the `rnorm()` function. You can specify the mean and standard deviation.

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and sd 1
random_numbers <- rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
print(random_numbers)
```

You can change the mean and standard deviation as needed:

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 100 and sd 20
random_numbers <- rnorm(10, mean = 100, sd = 20)
print(random_numbers)
```

## 3. Generating Random Integers

If you need random integers, the `sample()` function is useful. You can specify a range of numbers and how many to sample:

```r
# Generate 5 random integers between 1 and 100
random_integers <- sample(1:100, 5)
print(random_integers)
```

For sampling with replacement, which means numbers can repeat, you can set the `replace` argument to `TRUE`:

```r
# Generate 5 random integers between 1 and 100 with replacement
random_integers <- sample(1:100, 5, replace = TRUE)
print(random_integers)
```

## 4. Seeding Random Numbers

To ensure reproducibility (so you get the same random numbers every time you run the code), you can set a seed with the `set.seed()` function:

```r
# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate random numbers
random_numbers <- runif(5)
print(random_numbers)
```

This will generate the same random numbers each time you use the same seed.



## 5. Generating Random Numbers from Other Distributions
R provides functions to generate random numbers from various other probability distributions. Here are a few examples:

a) Exponential Distribution
To generate random numbers from an exponential distribution, use the `rexp()` function. The rate parameter defines the rate of the distribution.

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers from an exponential distribution with rate = 1
random_exponential <- rexp(10, rate = 1)
print(random_exponential)
```



b) Binomial Distribution
The `rbinom()` function generates random numbers from a binomial distribution. You need to specify the number of trials and probability of success.

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers from a binomial distribution with 10 trials and probability 0.5
random_binomial <- rbinom(10, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
print(random_binomial)
```



c) Poisson Distribution
The `rpois()` function is used to generate random numbers from a Poisson distribution. You specify the average rate of occurrence (lambda).

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers from a Poisson distribution with lambda = 4
random_poisson <- rpois(10, lambda = 4)
print(random_poisson)
```


d) Gamma Distribution
To generate random numbers from a gamma distribution, use the `rgamma()` function. You need to specify the shape and scale parameters.

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers from a gamma distribution with shape 2 and scale 1
random_gamma <- rgamma(10, shape = 2, scale = 1)
print(random_gamma)
```

e) Uniform Integer Sampling with runif()
Another way to generate random integers, though less common than `sample()`, is by using the runif() function and converting the output to integers.

```r
# Generate 10 random integers between 1 and 10
random_integers <- floor(runif(10, min = 1, max = 11))
print(random_integers)
```






f) Generating Random Numbers from the Beta Distribution
The `rbeta()` function generates random numbers from a Beta distribution. Specify the shape parameters shape1 and shape2.

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers from a Beta distribution with shape1 = 2 and shape2 = 5
random_beta <- rbeta(10, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5)
print(random_beta)
```

g) Generating Random Numbers from the Weibull Distribution
The `rweibull()` function generates random numbers from a Weibull distribution, with shape and scale parameters.

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers from a Weibull distribution with shape = 1.5 and scale = 2
random_weibull <- rweibull(10, shape = 1.5, scale = 2)
print(random_weibull)
```


h) Generating Random Numbers from the Chi-Squared Distribution
Use the rchisq() function to generate random numbers from a chi-squared distribution. Specify the degrees of freedom.

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers from a chi-squared distribution with 5 degrees of freedom
random_chisq <- rchisq(10, df = 5)
print(random_chisq)
```


i) Generating Random Numbers from the Student's t Distribution
The rt() function generates random numbers from the Student's t distribution. Specify the degrees of freedom.

```r
# Generate 10 random numbers from a t-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom
random_t <- rt(10, df = 10)
print(random_t)
```
