Using my Lenovo Slim 3 laptop for my studies without any major issues for 3 years. It had a Ryzen 3 processor, 1TB HDD, and a 256GB SSDâ€”perfectly adequate for my needs. But one day, all of a sudden faced troubles with my laptop ðŸ’».

## The Problem Starts

After shutting down my laptop the previous night, I powered it up the next morning. The power indicator lit up, but the screen remained black. I waited for a while, hoping it would eventually show something, but nothing appeared. I thought it may be display problem? I powered it off and on again. This time, the Lenovo logo appeared, and I felt relieved. But as soon as I logged in using password, the screen started glitching and then went completely black. The power indicator was still on, but the screen remained blank.


I tried restarting it several times, but the same thing kept happeningâ€”everything would power up fine, but the screen would go black after a few moments.






## Search for a Solution
I searched online and found that this might be a power-related issue. One suggested solution was to press and hold the power button for 60 seconds to discharge any residual power. I gave it a try, but it didnâ€™t work.



## First Repair Attempt
I took my laptop to a local repair shop. They opened it up, cleaned the RAM and SSD, and tested the device. It worked perfectly during their test, but once they put it all back together, the problem returned. They suspected that the issue might be with the soldered RAM on the motherboard and suggested I leave the laptop with them for further inspection.



After a week, they told me that the integrated graphics card on the motherboard had failed, and it couldnâ€™t be repaired. The only option was to replace the entire motherboard, which would cost around â‚¹10,000â€”about a third of the laptopâ€™s original price. This was too expensive for me, so I decided not to proceed with the repair.



I found another repair shop there and explained the situation. They informed me that repairs of this complexity couldnâ€™t be handled locally and would require the laptop to be sent to Kolkata. I agreed, hoping they could find a solution.

But finally the situation is still same.
