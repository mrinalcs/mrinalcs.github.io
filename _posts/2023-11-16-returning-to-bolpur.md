Got up at 4.30am.

Downloaded videos from youtube and movies including open heimer , The Nun 2 , Pinocchio, used approx 10 GB , then getting my phone in charge I started final packing. As its wasn't  6am I downloaded few more things . Finally its 6.15 I took 3 bags and one my father the havier one and set for station. Where I meet one of my class mate Preetam who had no changes for ticket so we took ticket together, then I went to animesh who was waiting in the east part of the station where we came across with Sharmila, anothr friend  after talking she left and the train comes when we took a sitting coatch by the way which seems to be crowdy.  

Now its few minutes and I remembered that I forgot to bring watter bottol.

## My Typing

Now a days I am noticing that my typing is horrible with slow speed , my fingures are so horrible actually not in phone but also with keyboard, actually I could type very fast but recently I am making too much miss typing. Such as to type something I am typing every letters but letters are messing around.

## Tebhaga Express

By this time I find that the train ðŸš† Tebhaga Express , Express by name only , Its shaking so horrably that seems like I am sitting in a bus, And the noise it producing making it more irritating. 

I loves children but a irritating nut is sitting infront of me. Both he and his father ruining my comfort. A very bad smell is flowing around. A very sweet old couple sitting by me who were sharing their foods.

How can I forget about Indian population,  The train is so overcrowded that barely people can move  , my fear triggered as I have  a laptop in my bag and four other  bags to carry which  includes my bedding and clothes.

In train journey its actually common to have come accross with begger , they are not only beggers but also snatchers also , actually I am not against or anything like that but its really irritating to see all this, most of them are not clean properly , they event touch with thir hand if not paying attention or money I personaly feels it wrong. 

## A Reel

I recently watch a post showing that oneside a mother and her children aturving for food and another hand a nonther and her daughter  celebrating dioawali . The scene itself not pleasing our eyes . We usually see this type of post during Diwali,holi but never in Eid or new year or Christmas.  I am not against this fact but this seems to potry a picture that only hindu feativals are like waste of food,water,money .... You also may notice this where they are so worried about pollution only due to hindu festivals. Though the major reason is something else but they are only concerned about Diwali.

Its hard to find any day when there is no trans in the train. Like  most of the times they ask for money and just asking. But I had one worst experience in my journey when a transgender misbehave not only me but also all the passengers who were not giving money.

## At Bolpur

Its too much crowd than usual reason maybe opening of classes. We have to wait a long time to pass the over bridge along the humans flow. It took about a hour more to reach my pg room, which was dirty and I had to clean. Finally I make myself comfortable in the room and got Wifi password, for which also I prefered this pg.
