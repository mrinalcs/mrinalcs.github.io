title: Covariance and Correlation

## Covariance

Consider two random variables $$ X $$ and $$ Y $$ Here, we define the covariance between X
 and Y
, written Cov(X,Y)

$$ \text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{n-1} $$

## Correlation

$$ \rho(X, Y) = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \cdot \sigma_Y} $$
