Reasons why one might want to change the CSS style of a website in their browser may be personal preference when it comes to aesthetics and design. If a website's default style doesn't align with ones preferences, he may choose to customize it to better suit their tastes.

Another reason may be accessibility. Not all websites are optimized for accessibility. By adjusting the CSS style, users can make websites more accessible by enhancing readability, increasing contrast, or adjusting font sizes, simplifying overly complex designs, or removing distracting elements that hinder navigation.

Furthermore, developers and designers may use browser tools to inspect and modify the CSS of websites for testing and debugging purposes. This allows them to experiment with different design variations, troubleshoot layout issues, or evaluate the impact of style changes on the browser before implementing them permanently.

Overall, the ability to change CSS styles in a browser provides users with flexibility, control, and customization options to enhance their browsing experience according to their preferences, accessibility needs, and usability requirements.
