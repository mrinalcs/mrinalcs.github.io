Its 17th November Friday class have started after puja vacation and after taking admission for MSc. Our department has been alloted for MSc classes the newly doneted land to Visva-Bharati [^3]. To see the new department I was too excited.

As my cycle locked in Sripalli Boys' Hostel's cycle garage, I went with Krishnendu, but as we didn't know the way to department we gathered all near Aroshree market and  went together. After a short but very zigzag turn we reached there.

## First Impressions

Here some of images taken by me .

## Evening
In the evening we went to take my cycle and to collect my marksheet. But as my cycle tire was punctured we have to walk till near sikha-bhavana office new building[^1] . There we got late and decided to go Shreeniketan to have some street food. I had a previous connection with Shreeniketan, I came here first time with a seniour. Later I alloted Elmhirst Boys' Hostel [^2]. Today most things were changed I didn't find the old Pakora stall where I used to come every weekend.
