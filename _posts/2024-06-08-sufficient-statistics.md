A sufficient statistic is best value for summarizing given sample data; You can use it even if you don’t know any of the actual values in the sample. Generally speaking, if something is sufficiently large, then it’s “big enough” for whatever purpose you’re using it for.

A statistic $$t = T(X)$$ is sufficient for underlying parameter θ precisely if the conditional probability distribution of the data  X, given the statistic $$t = T(X)$$, does not depend on the parameter θ.[4]
