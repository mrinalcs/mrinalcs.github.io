## Correlation


$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}
$$





- Correlation measures the statistical relationship between two variables.
- It indicates the strength and direction of a linear relationship between them.
- Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, where -1 represents a perfect negative correlation, 1 represents a perfect positive correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.


## Regression




$$
Y = b_0 + b_1X + \varepsilon
$$


- Regression is a statistical method that analyzes the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- It helps in predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.
- There are different types of regression (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression), each suited for specific types of relationships between variables.
